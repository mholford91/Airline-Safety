<br><br>
<u>Problem Statement<u><br>
Due to recent several unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel.

What was previously thought as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles, is now being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public.

<u>Initial Analysis, Solutions, and Presentation Summary<u><br>
The first graph in the presentation is to show how overall airline travel has become safer itself over the last 30 years. Air travel is a growing industry and has grown even popular in the last 15 years so the fact that there are fewer incidents and accidents with more travel is very telling in how safe air travel really is.
The next graph shows just how much safer air travel is than motor vehicles, as we can see one city has more incidents in a year than all of air travel combined in 14 years. Using more data on motor vehicle travel, we can show how air travel is significantly safer.
The third tree map looks at how airlines fit into the total of the incidents reported in 2000 to 2014. This graph is helpful to know where your airline stands and where you are at compared with competitors. Many of the airlines that have the most incidents are popular and well known US airlines as air travel is very common in the domestic United States for work and leisure. As a company it is important to know where you are at with your competitors to know where you need to work and what issues need to be addressed.
There are further charts showing how air travel is safer than it used to be and then lastly, the last two graphs show how the relationship between the incidents and accidents of 1985 to 1999 correlate to 2000 to 2014. Based on the graph for incidents, we can see a slight correlation in the number of incidents, but there is no correlation for the number of fatal accidents .
